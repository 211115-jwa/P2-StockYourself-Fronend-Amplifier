**If You Have a Mac**

2. Open a new terminal in your Documents folder like this. <br><br> ![terminal](./terminalAtFolder.png)

**Joint Instructions**

3. Go to this project's GitHub [page](https://github.com/211115-jwa/P2-StockYourself-backend-Amplifier) for the backend and click on the green code button to clone it. <br><br> ![Green-Button](./here.png)
4. Most of you want HTTPS
5. Click the double boxes to copy this command. <br><br> ![copy](./Copy.png)

**If You Have a Windows Computer**

6. Go back to your command prompt that you opened in step 4.

**If You Have a Mac**

6. Go back to your terminal that you opened in step 4.

**Joint Instructions**

7. Type
```
git clone [paste url here]
```
- Now we check if you have Java and if you do, which version.
8. In your command prompt/terminal type:
```
javac -version
```
9. It should look something like this. <br><br> ![javaVersion](./javaVer.png)
10. If there is no return value or the version number is below 8 go [here](https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/howto/JDK_Howto.html). Follow the instructions for your operating system.
11. Next you will install PostgreSQL from [here](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/install-postgresql/).  Follow the instructions for your operating system.
12. Install Eclipse from [here](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/installer)
13. Install DBeaver from [here](https://dbeaver.io/download/)
- In step 9. you cloned the repository into your new folder TRMS.  Now that you have Java, Postgres, Eclipse, and VS Code installed on your system, you are going to populate your new SQL database and run the program.
14. Open Eclipse IDE for Enterprise Developers
15. Go to File -> Import -> Maven -> Existing Maven Projects
16. Browse for trms-back
17. Finish
- The SQL scripts are in database
18. Open DBeaver
19. Go to File -> New
20. Select DBeaver -> Database Connection
21. Select the PostgreSQL Blue Elephant
22. Leave everything as it is
23. Check the connection, if not connecting, troubleshoot.
24. Finish
25. Make a application.properties in src/main/resources that looks similar to this: <br><br> ![copy](./props.png) 
26. Make a Schema called P2
27. Right click on P2, go to SQL Editor -> Open SQL Console
28. Copy the Script in DDL.sql into the SQL Console and run it.
29. Repeat step 29. then Copy the DML.sql into the new console and run it.
30. Expand src/main/java -> com.revature.stockYourself -> StockYourselfApplication.java
31. Right click on StockYourselfApplication.java
32. Select Run as -> Spring Boot Application 
33. Repeat steps 1 and 2
34. Go to this project's GitHub [page](https://github.com/211115-jwa/P2-StockYourself-Frontend-Amplifier) for the frontend and click on the green code button to clone it. <br><br> ![Green-Button](./here.png)
35. Repeat steps 4 - 8
36.
